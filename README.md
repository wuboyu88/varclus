# VarClus

This python script illustrates how to implement VarClus method which is
commonly used in SAS.

## Contributing
I simplified the codes from https://github.com/jingtt/varclushi. 
Now, I just want to know why the correlation coefficient
between a variable and a principal component can be calculated by this 
simple way implemented in the codes. I verified the correctness of the code
in correlation_coefficient_var_and_pc.py. If anyone knows the math behind it,
please contact me.

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
